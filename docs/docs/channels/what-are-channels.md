# What are Channels?

Simply, channel is a medium through which your notification will be delivered to your user. For example - Email, Push, SMS etc are different channels.

Engagespot believe that, a good product notification system should have a multi-channel strategy. Users assume different priority to Notifications coming through different channels. For example, if somebody messaged you in WhatsApp, you must be notified via a push notification on your mobile, not through email message.

A Product manager should always aim to build a smart multi-channel notification delivery system in their product to provide an awesome experience to their users.

Engagespot helps you add the following notifications channels to your product quickly without having to deploy your engineering team for months.

| Channel     | Identifier |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| In-App      | inApp      |
| Web Push    | webPush    |
| Email       | email      |
| Mobile Push | mobilePush |
| WhatsApp    | whatsapp   |
| SMS         | sms        |
| Slack       | slack      |

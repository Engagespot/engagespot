# What are Channels?

Simply, channel is a medium through which your notification will be delivered to your user. For example - Email, Push, SMS etc are different channels.

Engagespot believe that, a good product notification system should have a multi-channel strategy. Humans give different priority to Notifications coming through different channels. For example, if somebody messaged you in WhatsApp, you must be notified via a push notification on your mobile, not through email message.

It is the product manager's responsibility to ensure that their product has a smart multi-channel notification delivery system to provide an awesome experience to their users.

Engagespot helps you add the following notifications channels to your product quickly.

## In-App

In-App notification is the best to notify your users within the application. Almost all popular products like Facebook, LinkedIn, Trello, Jira etc have an in-app notification inbox. The advantage is that your users can see all their notifications in one place!

Engagespot providers realtime in-app notifications for web apps (Mobile app coming soon), along with a pre-built but heavily customizable ReactJS component library. Use it to embed a notification inbox inside your product with minimal coding!

## Web Push

To notify your users who are not currently using your web app, you should use web push. It delivers notification to your user's desktop / mobile device even if they donot have your website open in their browser! Engagespot supports inbuilt web push provider with zero config.

## Email

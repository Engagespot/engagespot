# Mandrill

You can send email notifications through Mandrill transactional email API.

## Unique Identifier

Each provider is identified by a unique identifier. Unique identifier of Mandrill provider is `mandrill_email`

## Enabling Mandrill Provider

To enable Mandrill provider, login to your Engagespot dashboard, goto Channels -> Email and enable Mandrill Provider.

:::info

Mandrill email provider uses `email` attribute in your user's [profile](../../../profile/what-are-user-profiles.mdx) as the primary address to deliver the notifications. So make sure your user's profile has the `email` attribute set.

:::

## Mandrill Provider Configurations.

Mandrill Provider requires the following configurations.

| Configuration | Description           | Required | Example                           |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| API_KEY       | Your Mandrill API Key | Yes      | 21b20a854e3df1ac46cb3aa2b9c6fd314 |
| FROM_EMAIL    | Sender email address    | Yes      | noreply@myapp.com                 |
| FROM_NAME     | Sender name    | Yes      | john doe                          |

## Advanced Delivery Tracking
It is **strongly advised** to follow the steps below for complete integration. Adding a webhook is the only way to receive timely updates on the result of the process after the message has been sent.

If you want the delivery status of your Email notifications to be available in Engagespot, you have to specify a call back URL in your Mandrill account.

1. For this, open your Mandrill App, then go to - **Settings -> Webhooks -> Create Webhook**
Paste the following URL into the  **Post to URL** input field

```
https://analytics.egspt.co/api/v1/apps/YOUR_ENGAGESPOT_APP_API_KEY/webhook/mandrill_email
```
Make sure to add your Engagespot app's API Key in the above URL, or else tracking won't work.

2. As the next step, Check all events, so all those events can be tracked by Engagespot.

3. Finally, click the create webhook button.

### What events can be tracked?

Currently, Engagespot tracks the following events from your Mandrill WhatsApp API.

|     Event      |            Description             |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| sent           |This is a status from Engagespot. This means, your notification has been successfully accepted by Mandrill API. But that may not guarantee delivery. |
| delivered      |Your Email has been delivered to your user, but has not been seen yet |
| seen           |Your Email was seen by the user. This event is tracked only for users who have open tracking enabled  |
| discarded      |For some reason, your message was not delivered. There will be an explanation along with the status |


## Overriding Configurations

Mandrill provider allows you to override all the above configurations (and you can specify several more options) while sending a notification through Engagespot API, using the `https://api.engagespot.co/v3/notifications` endpoint.

To override the configurations, you must supply them via `override.mandrill_email` parameter of the above API. Within the `override` parameter, you can supply any parameter that we'll directly pass to Mandrill `/messages/send` API [See doc](https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/api/messages/send-new-message). This makes sure you can use the complete features of Mandrill API while still using Engagespot to control your notifications!

For example,

**POST** `/notifications`

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Anand commented on your photo",
    "message": "Hey Steve, you're looking cool ðŸ˜Ž. Who took this photo?",
    "url": "https://your-app.com/photos/17293739",
    "category": "comment"
  },
  "recipients": ["steve@example.com"],
  "override": {
    "mandrill_email": {
      "_config": {
        "API_KEY": "21b20a854e3df1ac46cb3aa2b9c6fd314"
      },
      "message": {
        "subject": "Hey, I'm overriding the subject",
        "html": "I want more content in my email <b>notification</b>",
        "whatever": "keys and values you pass here will be directly sent to Mandrill's Send API ðŸŽ‰"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Within the override object of a provider, there is a `_config` property where you can override the default configurations defined in Engagespot dashboard for that provider. This property will be removed before merging the override object with providers API.

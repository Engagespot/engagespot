# Amazon SES

You can send email notifications through your AWS SES service.

## Unique Identifier

Each provider is identified by a unique identifier. Unique identifier of Amazon SES provider is `ses`

## Enabling AWS SES

To enable AWS SES provider, login to your Engagespot dashboard, goto Channels -> Email and enable AES SES Provider.

:::info

AWS SES provider uses `email` attribute in your user's [profile](../../../profile/what-are-user-profiles.mdx) as the primary address to deliver the notifications. So make sure your user's profile has the `email` attribute set.

### Create an AWS SES API Key and Secret using your AWS IAM Service

1. After logging into your <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Console</a>, search for the `IAM` service.

The `FROM_EMAIL` should be created as a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html">Verified Identity</a> in your SES account.

## AWS SES Configurations.

AWS SES requires the following configurations.

| Configuration | Description                                          | Required | Example        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS IAM Access Key ID | Yes      | 
| SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS IAM Secret Access Key                              | Yes      |              |
| REGION | Your AWS SES Region                         | Yes      |  us-west-2  |
| FROM_EMAIL | Verified <b>From Email</b> identity on your SES account                         | Yes      |    |

## Overriding Configurations

SES provider allows you to override all the above configurations (and you can specify several more options) while sending a notification through Engagespot API, using the `https://api.engagespot.co/v3/notifications` endpoint.

To override the configurations, you must supply them via `override` -> `ses` parameter of the above API. Configurations override values should be passed via `_config` object, and you can override `subject`, `text`, `html` and `from_name`

For example,

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Anand commented on your photo",
    "message": "Hey Steve, you're looking cool ðŸ˜Ž. Who took this photo?",
    "url": "https://your-app.com/photos/17293739",
    "category": "comment"
  },
  "recipients": ["steve@example.com"],
  "override": {
    "ses": {
      "_config": {
        "ACCESS_KEY_ID": "ANNHYAAJMLCPWRWGCNBSKHFY",
        "SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "nxxkjjuUtgVvcHjKpOJfdERFCJklytVbnkkksjshsgHHhsn",
        "REGION": "us-west-2",
        "FROM_EMAIL": "from@yourverifieddomain.com",
      },
      "from_name": "From Name",
      "subject": "Custom email subject",
      "text": "Email body plaintext",
      "html": "Email body with <h1>HTML</h1> support",
    }
  }
}
```

## Overriding Configurations

Postmark provider allows you to override all the above configurations (and you can specify several more options) while sending a notification through Engagespot API, using the `https://api.engagespot.co/v3/notifications` endpoint.

To override the configurations, you must supply them via `override` -> `postmark_email` parameter of the above API. 
Configurations override values should be passed via `_config` object, and you can directly supply any additional parameters that will be passed to Postmark API.

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Anand commented on your photo",
    "message": "Hey Steve, you're looking cool ðŸ˜Ž. Who took this photo?",
    "url": "https://your-app.com/photos/17293739",
    "category": "comment"
  },
  "recipients": ["steve@example.com"],
  "override": {
    "postmark_email": {
      "_config": {
        "SERVER_API_TOKEN": "ANNHYAAJMLCPWRWGCNBSKHFY",
      },
      "From": "sender@example.com",
      "To": "receiver@example.com",

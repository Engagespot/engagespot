# Getting Started

## Overview

Engagespot is built to help developers add a notification system to their products without having to write it from scratch. A complete notification system in a product consists of components like - Notification Feed UI, Realtime Notifications, Native/Desktop Push notifications etc. And in the backend you need to handle the complexities of storing push tokens, multiple devices for a single user, delivery logs etc. Thus, building a multi-channel notification engine is tricky and overwhelming. You'll spend more time coding it instead of your product.

Simply, you should never attempt to build a notification system from scratch. And that's why we've developed Engagespot. We focus on improving all the aspects of a highly scalable notification system while you focus on building your product.

### Channels

Engagespot helps you add three useful notification channels to your product.

1. In-App notification feed
2. Realtime notifications
3. Native browser push notifications.

### Supported Platforms

Currently, Engagespot is supported only on web based applications. (Support for Mobile Apps coming soon). To make it even easier for you, we have a pre-built UI Kit for React.js that you can simply embed on to your app. After front-end integration, to send notification programatically from your code, you can use our simple REST API.

# Introduction to Notification Batching
Notification Batching helps you to combine multiple notifications that are triggered in a short interval of time into one.
For example, if you are building a social network, you might have a notification in place to notify your users whenever someone comments on their post.
It will be like - <i>**User A commented on your post**</i>

Let's say the user's post went viral and he gets around 10 comments every second! Imagine how many notifications this will trigger. Most probably the user will get irritated and turn off notifications all together!
To avoid this, you can batch those 10 notifications into one - <i>**User A and 9 others commented on your post**</i>

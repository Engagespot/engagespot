This guide assumes that you've already went through the [Getting Started](/docs/introduction/getting-started) section. If you haven't already, please check it our first and then come back here. Don't worry, we'll wait ðŸ˜‰

Today, we'll see how to integrate a simple notification center on your React powered website.

Let's start by creating a new create-react-app project.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-notifications-app
cd my-notifications-app
npm start
```

If everything went well, you'll be seening this screen below

<!-- TODO:- Add Image for create react app -->

Next step is to add engagespot to our dependency.
We'll be using the component version of engagespot in this tutorial.

```bash
npm install @engagespot/react-component
```

:::info
Engagespot supports all popular modules systems namely **UMD**, **AMD**, **Commonjs** and **ESModules**. You are free to use it anywhere you want!
:::

Let's now create a new component called `Nav` and add some styles to it. This will act as the navigation bar where we'll integrate the notification center later.
We'll be using `styled-components` for styling this.

```jsx
// Nav.js
import styled from 'styled-components';
import React from 'react';

const NavBar = styled.nav`
  width: 100%;
  height: 56px;
  color: white;
  border-radius: 5%;
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen,
    Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
  background-color: orangered;
`;

const NavList = styled.ul`
  list-style-type: none;
  width: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
`;

const NavItem = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  padding: 0 2.5rem;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    transition: all 0.5s;
  }
`;

export default function Nav({ children }) {
  return (
    <NavBar>
      <NavList>{children}</NavList>
    </NavBar>
  );
}

Nav.NavItem = NavItem;
```

Now, import this component into your `App.js` and add a few `NavItem`s

```jsx
//App.js
import "./styles.css";
import Nav from "./Nav";
import { Engagespot } from "@engagespot/react-component";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Nav>
        <Nav.NavItem>Home</Nav.NavItem>
        <Nav.NavItem>About</Nav.NavItem>
        <Nav.NavItem>Contact</Nav.NavItem>
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Nice! Our Navigation is ready and things are really looking good. Only remaining step is to integrate our notification center. Let's import the `Engagespot` component for that

```jsx
import { Engagespot } from '@engagespot/core';
```

Add it as a `NavItem` with the required props

```jsx
<Nav.NavItem>
  <Engagespot apiKey="shiynklpz18l3ktqyy6d9a" userId="anandnew" />
</Nav.NavItem>
```

:::tip
Engagespot packages have built-in typescript support OOTB. So even if you're not using typescript in your apps, IDEs like VSCode
would give you autocompletion by reading the type definitions from the package. How cool is that?

If all went well, it should look somewhat like this ðŸ‘‡

<SimpleNotification />

Here's the complete code for what we done so far.

<iframe

  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '800px',
    border: '0',
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden',
  }}
  title="elegant-wiles-kcvvp"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

In the upcoming chapters, we'll discuss on how to customize the looks of notification center to make it truly your own!
